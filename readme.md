** Zabbix 2.4 Vagrant Config **

This VagrantFile and associated script will build out a Zabbix 2.4 server from source on CentOS 6.7.  

The config is based on the steps located here: http://bicofino.io/blog/2015/10/09/install-zabbix-2-dot-4-6-from-source-on-centos/

After vagrant up, you can attach to the VM on 192.168.33.10 Port 80  and login using the default Zabbix username and password.
